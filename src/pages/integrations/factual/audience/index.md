<a href="https://www.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> is the leading independent location technology platform. Foursquare enriches your first party data with real-world visitation data to better understand and engage your customers.

The Foursquare audience integration works in conjunction with the Foursquare feed integration. To receive enrichment data from Foursquare, you must first connect an audience. Foursquare processes the audience and then will send visit data for those customers via the feed integration.
